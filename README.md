This is a GPU (CUDA) implementation of a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method for gas dynamics.
The method fully described in the "Graphics processing unit based direct simulation Monte Carlo" paper
published in the SIMULATION journal in 2012 (http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0037549711418787).
The implementation features particle to geometry and inter-particle collisions and runs entirely on GPU.
